# debugga

DESCRIPTION
===========

DEBUGGA is a CSS framework focused on 
wireframe debugging and prototyping tool. 

Use the "debug" classes in your HTML to highlight 
elements and markups. Sometimes it is easier to use 
this instead of using the "Inspect Element" tools 
from Firebug or your browser's.

USAGE
=====

&lt;div id="your-id" class="your-classes debug"&gt;

DEBUGGA uses multiple name classes so you can fit it better to your authoring. There are currently 4 debug classes (debug, debug2, debug3 and debug4 plus variations) to highlight div widths and heights. You can also use it to visualize nested divs better.
