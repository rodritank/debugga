# debugga

DESCRIPTION
===========

DEBUGGA is a CSS framework focused on 
wireframe debugging and prototyping tool. 

Use the "debug" classes in your HTML to highlight 
elements and markups. Sometimes it is easier to use 
this instead of using the "Inspect Element" tools 
from Firebug or your browser's.

USAGE
=====

<div id="your-id" class="your-class debug"></div>

DEBUGGA uses multiple name classes so you can 
fit it better to your authoring. There are 
currently 4 debug classes 
(debug, debug2, debug3 and debug4 plus variations) 
to highlight div widths and heights, plus a 
special class that paints the div so you 
can see it better in the page.
